# SLA Best Practices

This document summarizes proven best practices for designing, managing,
and maintaining effective Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

---

## Design Principles

- Define SLAs only for measurable and monitorable metrics
- Avoid vague or subjective terms (e.g. “fast”, “high quality”)
- Align SLA targets with technical monitoring capabilities
- Reflect the shared responsibility model explicitly

---

## Metrics & Targets

- Prefer fewer, meaningful metrics over many weak indicators
- Define clear measurement periods (monthly, quarterly)
- Avoid unrealistic availability targets (e.g. 100%)
- Consider cost vs. service level trade-offs

---

## Incident Management

- Define priority levels clearly
- Separate response time and resolution time
- Ensure escalation paths are realistic and documented
- Align SLA targets with support operating hours

---

## Governance & Review

- Review SLAs regularly
- Adapt SLAs to service or usage changes
- Use reports to improve services, not only to enforce penalties
- Treat SLAs as living documents

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Focusing on metrics instead of customer value
- Defining SLAs without monitoring tools
- Overloading SLAs with too many KPIs
- Ignoring customer responsibilities
- Copying vendor SLAs without adaptation

---

## Practical Recommendation

SLAs work best when they are:
- Transparent
- Technically realistic
- Mutually understood
- Supported by operational processes
